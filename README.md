# Data_Product
Course project for Developing Data Products

Here at Faber College, we are beyond excited to welcome 2,450 first year students for the 2016 Fall Term. We receive more than 8,000 applications each year resulting in high competition. You may use this predictor to help determine if your academic credentials fall within our typical profile. Of course, admissions decisions are based on a rich multitude of factors, including extracurricular activities, your essay and recommendations. This predcitor is not your admissions decision - please use it only to set goals for your senior year of high school.

You may view the app's documentation [here](https://github.com/walkerkq/Data_Product/blob/master/include.Rmd) and it's pitch presentation [here](http://walkerkq.github.io/Data_Product_Presentation/index.html#1).
