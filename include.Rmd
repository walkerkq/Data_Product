# Admission Decision Predictor   
## Documentation    

This application is based on engineered enrollment data from a fictional college. The application predicts the likelihood of an applicant being accepted to Faber College given three academic variables: ACT, GPA and class rank. 

## Prediction Model  
The prediction is based on a linear model fit to the sample data using ACT, GPA and class rank as predictors. The sample data includes 50 observations.    

The data set contains the following variables:  
- ACT: ACT Score, int, range 15-36  
- GPA: grade point average, num, range 0-4.0  
- Class.Rank: student's academic rank, num, 0-1  
- Admission.Decision: where 1 represents admission granted and 0 represents denial of admission  

```{r showFit}
admission <- read.csv("data/sample_admission_data.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
head(admission)
fit <- lm(Admission.Decision ~ . -1, admission)
summary(fit)
